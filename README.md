# ECS deploy
ECS Deploy is a REST API server written in Go that can be used to deploy services on ECS from anywhere. It typically is executed as part of your deployment pipeline. Continuous Integration software (like Jenkins, CircleCI, Bitbucket or others) often don't have proper integration with ECS. This API server can be deployed on ECS and will be used to provide continuous deployment on ECS.
